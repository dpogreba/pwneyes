# PwnEyes v10.30 Release Notes

## Full-Screen Native UI Implementation

### Complete UI Architecture Redesign
- Replaced in-fragment navigation with a dedicated activity-based approach
- Each tab (Plugins, Peers, etc.) now launches as a full-screen experience
- Implemented ContentContainerActivity to host single fragment experiences
- This matches the intended application structure in the design document

### Technical Improvements
- Created dedicated ContentContainerActivity class for hosting fragments
- Added proper activity lifecycle management for fragment hosting
- Fixed navigation issues with native UI fragments
- Implemented complete separation between tabs as requested

### Debugging Enhancements
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the navigation flow
- Added visual indicators for tab transitions
- Improved error handling with detailed stack traces
- Fixed GridLayout dependency issues in the Plugins UI

### Other Improvements
- Updated AndroidManifest to include the new activity
- Added proper toolbar handling in the content container
- Improved back navigation behavior
- Maintained WebView fallback for tabs not yet implemented natively

This update represents a significant architectural shift that provides a more robust separation between different parts of the application. Each tab now functions as an independent screen rather than being constrained within the existing UI, exactly matching the intended design.
