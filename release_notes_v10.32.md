# PwnEyes v10.32 Release Notes

## WebView-Based Plugins UI in Separate Activity

### Implementation Overview
- Replaced native UI grid with a WebView in the Plugins screen
- Modified the PluginsFragment to load the plugins URL directly in a WebView
- Maintained the separate activity approach from v10.30 for clean navigation
- Combined the best of both approaches: separate screen with WebView content

### Technical Improvements
- Removed native grid layout and card components for plugins
- Added WebView component to the fragment_plugins.xml layout
- Implemented complete WebView configuration with proper authentication
- Added URL formatting to ensure correct plugins path is loaded
- Maintained the toolbar and tab navigation for consistent UI

### Architecture Enhancements
- Aligned implementation with the provided architecture diagram
- Now properly showing the plugins content in a WebView within a separate activity
- Created a more consistent approach that can be extended to other tabs
- Improved URL handling and WebView configuration

### WebView Configuration
- Added proper WebView lifecycle management to prevent memory leaks
- Implemented error handling for WebView loading issues
- Added URL display in the green indicator bar
- Ensured authentication is properly handled for secure connections

This update completes the implementation of the architecture shown in the diagram. The app now properly navigates from the home view's WebView to a completely separate activity when plugins content is detected, but maintains a WebView within that separate activity to display the plugins content - exactly as requested.
