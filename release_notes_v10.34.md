## "See What's New!" Feature

### New User Experience
- Added "See What's New!" button in the navigation drawer that appears after app updates
- Implemented an automatic version tracking system to detect when the app has been updated

This update provides a clean way for users to discover new features after updating the app. When a user updates PwnEyes to a newer version, they'll see a "ðŸŽ‰ See What's New!" option at the bottom of the navigation drawer. Tapping this option shows a dialog with all the latest changes and improvements. After viewing the changes, the menu item disappears until the next update.
