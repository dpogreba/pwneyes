## Accessibility Improvements

In this release, we've introduced a comprehensive suite of accessibility features to make PwnEyes more inclusive and usable for all users, including those with visual impairments.

### New Accessibility Features

- **Font Size Adjustment**: Choose from small, normal, large, or extra large text sizes to improve readability throughout the app.

- **High Contrast Mode**: Enable a high-contrast color scheme that enhances text visibility and makes the app easier to use for users with low vision.

- **Text-to-Speech Feedback**: Get spoken feedback for important actions and content within the app, making navigation easier without needing to read on-screen text.

- **Larger Touch Targets**: Increase the size of buttons and interactive elements, making them easier to tap and interact with.

- **Enhanced Screen Reader Support**: Improved compatibility with screen readers through better content descriptions and accessibility focus management.

- **Reduced Animations**: Option to simplify visual transitions for users who are sensitive to motion or find animations distracting.

### Implementation Details

- A new "Accessibility" section has been added to the Settings menu with simple toggles for each feature.

- All accessibility settings are preserved between app sessions.

- High contrast mode follows WCAG guidelines for color contrast ratios.

- Text-to-speech uses the device's default TTS engine and language settings.

- Larger touch targets comply with accessibility best practices for minimum tap area size.

These improvements help make PwnEyes more accessible to users with various visual impairments while maintaining the app's functionality and design aesthetic for all users.
