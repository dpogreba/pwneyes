# WebView Scrolling Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the WebView in ConnectionViewerFragment to provide better scrolling capabilities and full support for web content. This improves the user experience when viewing web interfaces from connected devices, particularly for content that requires scrolling.

## Changes Made

### WebView Settings Enhancements
- Added critical viewport rendering settings:
  ```kotlin
  loadWithOverviewMode = true
  useWideViewPort = true
  ```
- Enabled proper scroll bars:
  ```kotlin
  isVerticalScrollBarEnabled = true
  isHorizontalScrollBarEnabled = true
  scrollBarStyle = View.SCROLLBARS_INSIDE_OVERLAY
  overScrollMode = View.OVER_SCROLL_ALWAYS
  ```
- Enabled additional settings for better web content rendering:
  ```kotlin
  allowContentAccess = true
  allowFileAccess = true
  mixedContentMode = WebSettings.MIXED_CONTENT_ALWAYS_ALLOW
  ```

### JavaScript Support Improvements
- Added WebChromeClient to handle JavaScript dialogs (alerts, confirms, prompts)
- Implemented custom handling for specific dialog types, including shutdown confirmations
- Added console message logging for debugging

### UI Improvements
- Changed progress bar from circular spinner to horizontal progress at the top of the screen
- Added progress percentage updates during page loading

### Error Handling
- Maintained all existing error handling functionality
- Preserved authentication mechanisms for protected web interfaces

## Benefits
- Pages that were previously not scrollable can now be fully scrolled
- Web interfaces designed for desktop browsers display properly
- JavaScript dialogs work correctly, enhancing interaction with device web interfaces
- Improved loading progress indication gives better feedback to users

## Technical Note
These changes implement the same high-quality WebView configuration that exists in the WebViewManager class, but directly in the ConnectionViewerFragment where it's needed for device connections.
